# Assignment Mismatch Analysis

## Problem Summary

The system is looking for:
- **Complaint ID**: `b936a621-7a4b-400e-bc8a-be4c336e89e7`
- **Officer ID** (current user): `8e6aa537-86bb-4097-bbd6-b0789f877b9e`

Query finds: **2 assignments** for this complaint
But: **NONE match the current officer's ID**

## Possible Causes

### 1. Wrong User ID in Database
The assignments in `complaint_assignments` have `assigned_to` set to a DIFFERENT user ID than your current user.

### 2. You're Not the Assigned Officer
You might be trying to complete an assignment that was given to someone else.

### 3. Assignment Was Reassigned
The assignment might have been reassigned to a different officer.

## How to Check

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check all assignments for this complaint
SELECT 
  ca.id,
  ca.complaint_id,
  ca.assigned_to,
  ca.assigned_by,
  ca.status,
  au.email as officer_email,
  admin_user.email as admin_email
FROM complaint_assignments ca
LEFT JOIN auth.users au ON ca.assigned_to = au.id
LEFT JOIN auth.users admin_user ON ca.assigned_by = admin_user.id
WHERE ca.complaint_id = 'b936a621-7a4b-400e-bc8a-be4c336e89e7';
```

This will show:
- Who the assignments are assigned TO (`assigned_to` and officer email)
- Who assigned them (`assigned_by` and admin email)
- Current status of assignments

## Solution

You need to either:
1. Use the complaint that YOU are assigned to
2. Or be assigned to this complaint by an admin first
