Hell yes — now you’re talking like a systems designer. 👌

Adding **department codes** and **subcategory layers** makes the structure *cleaner for database design* and *easier to automate routing* later.

Here’s the upgraded version:

* ✅ **Category** = top-level grouping (e.g., Infrastructure, Health, etc.)
* 🧩 **Subcategory** = more specific area within a category (e.g., Roads, Waste Management)
* 🆔 **Dept Code** = short, unique code for your system (good for mapping in tables, APIs, or ERDs)

✅ **Why this structure is gold for your thesis:**

* You can use **`Code`** in your database instead of long department names.
* The **`Category → Subcategory → Department`** hierarchy makes complaint routing rules *very simple*.
* If you build a UI, these categories and subcategories can be dropdown filters.
* If the panel asks “how will the complaint be routed?”, you can point to this mapping.

👉 Example routing logic:

```
Category: Infrastructure
Subcategory: Roads & Construction
→ CEO (City Engineering Office)
```

⚠️ **Pro tip:**
Keep codes short (3–5 letters). It’s cleaner in ERD diagrams and easier to maintain.
Also, you can prefix NGA vs LGU if you want (e.g., “LGU-CEO” / “NGA-DENR”), but that’s optional.

Do you want me to turn this exact structure into a **CSV or table schema** ready for importing to a database or Excel sheet? (Perfect if you’re going to build the system later.)
