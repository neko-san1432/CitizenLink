## 🗃️ Database Schema Usage

### Tables Used:
1. **`departments`** (bigint ID, not UUID)
   - `id` - Auto-generated integer ID
   - `name` - Department full name
   - `code` - Short code (e.g., 'wst', 'engineering')

2. **`complaints`**
   - `id` - UUID
   - `title` - Complaint title
   - `descriptive_su` - Description (not `description`)
   - `location_text` - Location string
   - `submitted_at` - Submission timestamp (not `created_at`)
   - `submitted_by` - User ID (not `user_id`)
   - `primary_department` - Department code (text field)

3. **`complaint_assignments`**
   - `id` - UUID
   - `complaint_id` - Foreign key to complaints
   - `department_id` - NULLABLE (can be null for direct assignments)
   - `assigned_to` - Officer user ID (nullable)
   - `assigned_by` - Admin/coordinator user ID
   - `status` - 'pending' | 'active' | 'completed'
   - `priority` - 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent'
   - `deadline` - Timestamp (nullable)
   - `notes` - Text (nullable)
   - `created_at` - Creation timestamp
   - `updated_at` - Last update timestamp (used as assignment time)

4. **`notification`** (singular table name)
   - Used to send notifications to officers when assigned

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

### Authentication:
- All routes require valid JWT token
- Uses `authenticateUser` middleware

### Authorization:
- Routes restricted to `lgu-admin` and `lgu-admin-*` roles
- Regex matching: `/^lgu-admin/` matches any role starting with `lgu-admin`
- Department isolation: Admins only see assignments for their own department

### Department Matching Logic:
```javascript
// Extract department code from role
const departmentCode = userRole.replace('lgu-admin-', '');
// Example: 'lgu-admin-wst' → 'wst'

// Filter assignments by matching complaint.primary_department
const departmentAssignments = assignments.filter(a => 
  a.complaints?.primary_department === departmentCode
);
```

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

   - Sets deadline and adds notes
4. **LGU Officer** receives notification
5. **Officer** completes the task
6. **Admin** can track completion

## 🐛 Issues Fixed During Implementation

### 1. **Supabase Import Error**
- **Problem:** `Cannot find module '../../config/supabase'`
- **Fix:** Changed to `const Database = require('../config/database'); const supabase = db.getClient();`

### 2. **Role Matching**
- **Problem:** `lgu-admin-wst` denied access (exact string match failed)
- **Fix:** Added regex pattern `/^lgu-admin/` to match all `lgu-admin-*` roles

### 3. **Table Names**
- **Problem:** Code used `department` (singular) but table is `departments` (plural)
- **Fix:** Updated all references to use `departments`

### 4. **Column Names**
- **Problems:**
  - `description` → `descriptive_su`
  - `created_at` → `submitted_at`
  - `user_id` → `submitted_by`
  - `assigned_at` column doesn't exist
- **Fix:** Updated all column references; use `updated_at` as assignment time

### 5. **Department ID Type Mismatch**
- **Problem:** `departments.id` is bigint but query expected UUID
- **Fix:** Filter assignments by `complaints.primary_department` (text code) instead of `department_id`

### 6. **CSS Files Missing**
- **Problem:** HTML referenced non-existent CSS files
- **Fix:** Updated to use only `style.css` and `toast.css`

### 7. **Header/Sidebar Not Rendering**
- **Problem:** Missing proper container structure
- **Fix:** Added `.app-container`, `.header-container` divs and included auth scripts

---

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Fully Functional:
- Page loads correctly with header and sidebar
- API successfully returns 3 assignments for WST department
- Statistics display correctly (0 unassigned, 2 urgent, 1 high)
- All assignment cards render with complete information
- Filter buttons work
- Modal opens for assignment

### ⚠️ Notes:
- Officers count shows 0 (need to seed LGU officer users in department)
- Can only test full assignment flow once officers are added

---

## 🚀 Testing the Feature

### Prerequisites:
1. Run `sql/seed_departments.sql` to create departments
2. Run `sql/seed_complaints_and_notifications.sql` to create test data
3. Have a user with `lgu-admin-wst` role

### Access:
1. Login as LGU Admin (e.g., `lgu-admin-wst`)
2. Click "📋 Department Assignments" in sidebar
3. View assignments for your department
4. Click "Assign to Officer" on unassigned complaints

## 📝 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Bulk Assignment:** Assign multiple complaints at once
2. **Assignment History:** View past assignments
3. **Performance Metrics:** Track officer completion rates
4. **Reassignment:** Transfer assignments between officers
5. **Deadline Alerts:** Notify when deadlines approach
6. **Search/Sort:** Search by complaint details, sort by various fields
