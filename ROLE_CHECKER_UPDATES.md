# ✅ Role Checker Updates - Complete

## 🎯 New Roles Added

The system now supports **6 user roles** (up from 3):

| Role | Dashboard Path | Actual Dashboard File |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| `citizen` | `/dashboard` → auto-routes | `/citizen/dashboard.html` |
| **`lgu-officer`** ⭐ | `/dashboard` → auto-routes | `/lgu/dashboard.html` |
| **`complaint-coordinator`** ⭐ | `/dashboard` → auto-routes | `/coordinator/dashboard.html` |
| `lgu-admin` | `/dashboard` → auto-routes | `/lgu-admin/dashboard.html` |
| **`lgu-hr`** ⭐ | `/dashboard` → auto-routes | `/hr/dashboard.html` |
| `super-admin` | `/dashboard` → auto-routes | `/super-admin/dashboard.html` |

⭐ = New roles added

**✨ Simplified Routing:** All roles just go to `/dashboard` and the system automatically serves the correct dashboard based on their role!

## 📝 Files Updated

### ✅ `src/server/app.js`

#### 1. **Dashboard Path Mapping** (`getDashboardPath`)
```javascript
getDashboardPath(userRole) {
  const roleDashboards = {
    citizen: path.join(config.rootDir, "views", "pages", "citizen", "dashboard.html"),
    lgu: path.join(config.rootDir, "views", "pages", "lgu", "dashboard.html"),
    "lgu-officer": path.join(config.rootDir, "views", "pages", "lgu", "dashboard.html"), // ⭐ NEW
    "complaint-coordinator": path.join(config.rootDir, "views", "pages", "coordinator", "dashboard.html"), // ⭐ NEW
    "lgu-admin": path.join(config.rootDir, "views", "pages", "lgu-admin", "dashboard.html"),
    "lgu-hr": path.join(config.rootDir, "views", "pages", "hr", "dashboard.html"), // ⭐ NEW
    "super-admin": path.join(config.rootDir, "views", "pages", "super-admin", "dashboard.html"),
  };

  return roleDashboards[userRole] || roleDashboards.citizen;
}
```

**What this does:**
- When a user logs in and goes to `/dashboard`, the system automatically routes them to their role-specific dashboard
- `lgu-officer` shares the same dashboard as `lgu` (task-focused)
- Each new role gets its own dedicated dashboard

#### 2. **Simplified Dashboard Routing**

**No explicit dashboard routes needed!** The single `/dashboard` route handles everything:

```javascript
// Single dashboard route for ALL roles
this.app.get("/dashboard", authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
  const userRole = req.user?.role || "citizen";
  const dashboardPath = this.getDashboardPath(userRole);
  res.sendFile(dashboardPath);
});

// getDashboardPath() automatically routes to the correct file based on role
```

**Result:** 
- User goes to `/dashboard`
- System checks their role from `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data.role`
- Serves the appropriate dashboard HTML file
- Simple, clean, maintainable! ✨

**Updated Existing Routes:**
```javascript
// Task Assigned page - added lgu-officer
this.app.get("/taskAssigned", 
  authenticateUser, 
  requireRole(["lgu", "lgu-officer", /^lgu-/]),  // ⭐ Added lgu-officer
  (req, res) => { /* ... */ }
);

// Departments admin page - added lgu-hr
this.app.get("/admin/departments", 
  authenticateUser, 
  requireRole(["lgu-admin", "lgu-hr", "super-admin"]),  // ⭐ Added lgu-hr
  (req, res) => { /* ... */ }
);
```

**Dashboard Shortcuts (Optional Convenience):**
```javascript
// These shortcuts just redirect to /dashboard
this.app.get("/coordinator", authenticateUser, requireRole(["complaint-coordinator"]), 
  (req, res) => { res.redirect("/dashboard"); });

this.app.get("/hr", authenticateUser, requireRole(["lgu-hr"]), 
  (req, res) => { res.redirect("/dashboard"); });

this.app.get("/super-admin", authenticateUser, requireRole(["super-admin"]), 
  (req, res) => { res.redirect("/dashboard"); });
```

**Why shortcuts?** Users might type `/coordinator` or `/hr` - these redirect to `/dashboard` which serves the correct dashboard.

### API Testing

**Test Simplified Dashboard Routing:**
```bash
# Login as different roles and go to /dashboard
# System automatically serves the correct dashboard file

# As citizen
curl http://localhost:3000/dashboard -H "Cookie: sb_access_token=CITIZEN_TOKEN"
# Expected: Serves /citizen/dashboard.html

# As lgu-officer
curl http://localhost:3000/dashboard -H "Cookie: sb_access_token=OFFICER_TOKEN"
# Expected: Serves /lgu/dashboard.html

# As complaint-coordinator
curl http://localhost:3000/dashboard -H "Cookie: sb_access_token=COORDINATOR_TOKEN"
# Expected: Serves /coordinator/dashboard.html

# As lgu-hr
curl http://localhost:3000/dashboard -H "Cookie: sb_access_token=HR_TOKEN"
# Expected: Serves /hr/dashboard.html

# As super-admin
curl http://localhost:3000/dashboard -H "Cookie: sb_access_token=SUPERADMIN_TOKEN"
# Expected: Serves /super-admin/dashboard.html
```

**Test Role-Based Feature Access:**
```bash
# Try accessing admin features as citizen (should fail)
curl http://localhost:3000/appointMembers \
  -H "Cookie: sb_access_token=CITIZEN_TOKEN"
# Expected: 403 Forbidden

# Try accessing HR features as HR (should work)
curl http://localhost:3000/admin/departments \
  -H "Cookie: sb_access_token=HR_TOKEN"
# Expected: 200 OK
```

## 🗂️ Dashboard Files Verified

All dashboard HTML files exist:

```
✅ views/pages/citizen/dashboard.html
✅ views/pages/lgu/dashboard.html (used by lgu-officer too)
✅ views/pages/coordinator/dashboard.html
✅ views/pages/lgu-admin/dashboard.html
✅ views/pages/hr/dashboard.html
✅ views/pages/super-admin/dashboard.html
```

## 🔄 Integration with Other Systems

### Role Toggle System
The role checker works seamlessly with the role toggle:
- Staff can toggle to citizen mode
- Client-side: `localStorage` tracks active role
- Server-side: Always validates against actual `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data.role`
- Dashboard routing respects active role

### Notification System
Notifications are sent based on user role:
- `lgu-officer` → Gets task assignment notifications
- `complaint-coordinator` → Gets review queue notifications
- `lgu-hr` → Gets role change notifications
- All integrated with `NotificationService`

### Sidebar Navigation
`src/client/components/sidebar.js` was already updated to show role-specific links:
- Officers see "Task Assigned" link
- Coordinators see "Coordinator" link
- HR sees "HR Management" link
- Super Admin sees all links

---

## 📚 Constants Reference

All roles defined in `src/shared/constants.js`:

```javascript
const USER_ROLES = {
