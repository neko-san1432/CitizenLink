# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to security@citizenlink.local

## Security Measures Implemented

### Code Analysis
- **CodeQL**: Automated security scanning with GitHub CodeQL
- **ESLint Security**: Enhanced security rules for JavaScript code
- **npm audit**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

### Runtime Security
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input validation
- **XSS Protection**: HTML sanitization and Content Security Policy
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js security headers

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with complexity rules
- **Session Security**: Secure cookies with httpOnly and sameSite flags
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery prevention

## Auto-Resolution Features

This project includes automated tools to resolve common security issues:

### Automatic Fixes
- npm dependency vulnerability fixes
- ESLint security rule violations
- Common JavaScript security anti-patterns

### Manual Review Required
Some security issues require manual review and cannot be auto-resolved:
- Complex input validation logic
- Business logic security decisions
- Third-party library security assessments

## Running Security Scans

```bash
# Run all security scans
npm run security-scan

# Run ESLint with security rules
npm run lint

# Check for dependency vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Run CodeQL analysis (via GitHub Actions)
# Automatically runs on push/PR to main branch
```
